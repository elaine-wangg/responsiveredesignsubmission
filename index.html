            Redesigning a website for a small local clinic can help improve its
            online presence, attract more patients, and provide a better
            experience for those seeking its healthcare services.

              <p>Purposes of Webpage</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Identifying services (found in the links below its
                  introduction).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enrolling in insurance and current care (found in the links
                  below its introduction).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Locations and hours / contact information (found in the header
                  bar).
                </li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                Overall, typical tasks can be done quickly within 3-4 clicks
                since most of the links are self-explanatory. However, the
                layout may make it difficult to view due to font size.

              <h4>Learnability: Is it easy to learn?</h4>
              <p>Layout of Webpage</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Small headings bar containing information about page
                  navigation and current page is underlined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Central blue block of information containing information about
                  Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQCHs) and a number to
                  call for language assistance services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Below is a set of common links with relevant news articles for
                  credibility. However, text flows beyond the box.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Overall, the page is simple with important information located
                at the very top of the page and below its introduction.
              </p>
              <h4>Memorability: Is it easy to recall what to do?</h4>
              <p>
                In general, the website's usability for recall is limited. The
                information is distributed throughout the text and images,
                making it challenging to remember the location of specific
                information or links without thorough scanning. However, users
                typically expect a navigation bar on most pages, which helps
                them understand where to find information.

                <h4>WebAIM WAVE</h4>
                <p>
                  The WebAIM WAVE tool has identified issues with the language
                  of the document not being identified or having an invalid lang
                  attribute value. I largely agree with this assessment.
                  However, upon initial page load, an audio recording provides a
                  phone number, which aids visually impaired users in accessing
                  website information via phone. Additionally, the tool has
                  flagged missing alternative text for images, which means that
                  screen reader users or those with images disabled may not have
                  access to image content. Moreover, without regions and ARIA
                  landmarks to identify significant page areas, users may find
                  it difficult to navigate through the content efficiently. They
                  may struggle to understand the overall structure of the page
                  and find specific sections quickly.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>"In completing this Responsive Redesign project, I have gained valuable skills in evaluating, redesigning, and building a responsive website. Through the process of analyzing usability problems, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, and implementing a responsive design using HTML/CSS, I have learned how to identify and address design flaws, create visually appealing interfaces, and ensure accessibility across different screen sizes. This project has allowed me to practice the entire design process from start to finish, honing my skills in design thinking, visual design, and front-end development. Overall, I have gained a deeper understanding of the intersection between design and development, and I am confident in my ability to create portfolio-ready work that is both effective and usable."</p>
